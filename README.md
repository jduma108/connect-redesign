# Connect Website Redesign 

As a final project for Webpage Production I, I redesigned RIT's School of Media Sciences: Connect website using HTML, CSS, SASS, Bourbon and Saffron. This was the first website I build from the ground-up. All content was provided from the School of Media Science: Connect official website. Please note: The original Connect website has been rebranded to RIT School of Media Sciences and follows a different style than my redesign was based off of.
