                <h2>December 3rd, 2015, by Megan Cooper
                </h2>
                <p>The Gravure Industry is at a crossroads. Its place in the industry is changing now more than ever
                    with the introduction of new packaging technology and media outlets. On November 11th, 2015 RIT’s
                    School of Media Sciences hosted Gravure Day, which was an opportunity for students, professors, and
                    industry experts to discuss these changes. Speakers included three professionals from the industry
                    and was a great networking opportunity for students.</p>

                <p>This event was organized by the School of Media Sciences’ Gravure Endowed Professor, Robert Eller.
                    Professor Eller opened the event with a presentation called, “Gravure at a Crossroads Exploring
                    Options for the Future.” His presentation introduced the topic of understanding the future of the
                    Gravure Industry by demonstrating two paths that it might take. These two paths involve Gravure
                    retreating to a niche technology or reinventing itself to better fulfill needs in the industry it
                    already serves. In retreating to a niche, Gravure has the opportunity to find areas where its
                    technology is unique and will be advantaged. Retreat has the possibility of making Gravure
                    applications more profitable. Another option is the idea of a reinvention of the Gravure business
                    model. One of the aspects of Gravure that differentiates it from other printing technologies is the
                    use of engraved cylinders. The benefits of using cylinders include better consistency, higher speed,
                    and better color quality and saturation. By exploiting these benefits and addressing current
                    weaknesses, the Gravure industry has the opportunity to reinvent its business model to better
                    satisfy the needs of the industry.</p>

                <p>The talk consisted of a discussion about these two paths for Gravure and how students could prepare
                    themselves for a career in the industry. The attendees heard a presentation from David Haslam on the
                    opportunity in sleeve technology for the industry as well as a discussion from Eric Haapakoski on
                    cylinder inventory management.</p>

                <p>The last part of the event consisted of information on scholarship and career opportunities within
                    the industry. Rod Sosa presented an overview of the Gravure Education Foundation, which supports
                    educational development in the Gravure industry. Over $3.6 million have been awarded in scholarships
                    to students with nine corporate and three memorial scholarships available through their website for
                    students to apply. Sosa also hinted that relatively few people take advantage of these awards, so
                    students who apply have a good chance to win an award. Awards range from $1,000-$5,000 and there are
                    opportunities to win multiple scholarships. Applications for next year’s awards will be available
                    early 2016 and information can be found on the GAA Scholarship website.</p>

                <p>In additions to scholarships, the speakers discussed job applications and interviewing. Their advice
                    for those job hunting was to “attack what side of the industry you want to work in.” They also
                    emphasized how the vendors are currently growing and where would be the best place to look for jobs.
                </p>

                <p>“Become an expert in branding and marketing yourself…When you are in an interview, you are actually
                    interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. Make sure it is a two-way conversation.”</p>

                <p>– Rod Sosa, Plant Manager, Fresco Systems</p>

                <p>Each speaker stressed the importance of doing research about the company and coming to the interview
                    with questions as well as having physical experience with the presses.</p>

                <p>The event allowed for open discussion between the students and speakers, which was a great networking
                    opportunity for both. The School of Media Sciences is looking forward to how the students will play
                    a role in the future of the Gravure industry and how their roles will impact the path this industry
                    takes.</p>
