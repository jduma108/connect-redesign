                <h2>December 15th, 2013, by Gabrielle Barandiaran
                </h2>
                <p>This summer I had the privilege of working for Partners + Napier— a creative ideas agency here in
                    Rochester, New York. P+N is an “agency that specializes in crafting engagement-based solutions to
                    big business and brand challenges.” – P+N</p>

                <p>I was hired as the Account Executive Intern and worked directly with an Account Executive on his
                    accounts. I was actively involved with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Delta Private Jets, Capital
                    One, Lactalis (Président Gourmet Cheese), Hotel California Tequila and Gannett Publishing.</p>

                <p>As a Media Arts and Technology major with a minor in Business and experience in sales, I fit the job
                    like a glove. My first job was to get “grounded” in any account I touched. I needed to know my
                    client’s business as well as the client. My boss always stressed that as an Account Executive you
                    need to be the second smartest person in the room, it’s key to maintaining the relationship with the
                    client and growing the account. Getting grounded meant a lot of research. I know research isn’t
                    always a word we like to hear, but when it comes to agency life it’s a fun one! Every account has
                    their own story and it is fun getting to know what makes them unique and eventually what will be
                    leveraged in any project or campaign that will be developed for them.</p>

                <p>Once I knew what was going on, I was allowed to get my hands dirty. I sat in on countless meetings
                    both internally and externally to discuss ongoing or future projects that the agency would take on.
                    Partners always stressed how imperative it was to work as a team for each client. Weekly meetings
                    were held with the account team, production, project management and creative to touch base on the
                    status of projects for each account. This is where my knowledge as a Media Arts and Technology major
                    kicked in— to sit in a room full of left and right brained professionals and understand the lingo
                    each was speaking was priceless. As a student it can be difficult to understand why it is necessary
                    to learn about “kerning” in Professor Riordan’s Digital Foundations class; or “metadata” with
                    Professor Anthony in Information Architecture; and even the finance and accounting basics from
                    Professor Birkett in Media Business Basics—but here it was all rolled into one weekly meeting.</p>

                <p>In addition to working on P+N’s active accounts, the interns were assigned a client of our own:
                    Fina’s Café and Catering. Our intern group was compiled of 3 designers, 1 project manager and 2
                    account executives. The challenge was to extend Fina’s successful cafe business and drive attention
                    to their catering services. During this process, we re-branded the café— giving it a new look and
                    feel, logo included. At the end, the final deliverable was a “Marketing Guide” book. This book
                    introduced the new brand, a style guide on how to use it, a premium collateral piece to drive
                    awareness of catering, packaging options and production estimate costs. This experience made the
                    internship unique in that we operated as our own agency and were responsible for our own timeline
                    and bringing the project to completion.</p>

                <p>My time at P+N opened my eyes to a whole new environment. Before working for them, I was not versed
                    in the world of advertising and I was unaware of how a Media Arts and Technology major could fit
                    into that world. If I could offer anyone seeking a co-op a piece of advice, it would be to keep an
                    open mind and be willing to take on a position where you get to not only apply what you already know
                    but get to learn new things as well.</p>
