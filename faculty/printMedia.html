                <h2>March 3rd, 2015, by Megan Cooper
                </h2>
                <p>Dr. Chang is a professor in the graduate program, MS Print Media, in the College of Imaging Arts and
                    Sciences. Chang earned her Ph. D. in Material Science at the University of Minnesota. She found a
                    degree in Material Science very interesting because it applied to real scenarios in the print
                    industry. After school, she first worked at Xerox in printing technologies, material science
                    research, and printing sustainability research. Chang now has over 27 years of experience in Digital
                    Printing and has done extensive research in the 3D printing industry. Her goal for the future of
                    additive manufacturing is to find ways to bridge the gap between conventional digital printing
                    manufacturers and 3D printing researchers. She works with graduate students in Print Media to
                    conduct research on various processes of 3D printing.</p>

                <p>Some examples of what her students’ research includes second year graduate student, Di Bai, who is
                    conducting research to locate particles in a microstructure and identify the particles’ ability to
                    become a three-dimensional printed object using powder systems. His findings can produce new
                    processes related to the construction, design, and performance in functional printing. Two other
                    students, Heng Li and Nathan Ostrout, are performing experiments to study 3D printer capabilities by
                    designing and producing test targets for the system. Nathan is studying the process of a 3D printer
                    to determine how the machine finds an accurate measurement of a specific test target. In his
                    analysis he will evaluate the printers dimensional capabilities. The goal of Heng Li’s research is
                    to create a measurement system that accurately calculates the dimensions of a 3D object. Past
                    students have also focused on areas such as Interactive Printing and Functional Graphics under Dr.
                    Chang’s advising. The 3D printing process has many areas that have yet to be researched, and Dr.
                    Chang’s knowledge and active contribution to the field generates a lot of interest to both graduate
                    and undergraduate students.</p>

                <p>In addition to her work in the graduate school, Dr. Chang teaches 3D Printing Workflow, which is
                    offered to undergraduate students in the spring semester.</p>
                </p>
