                <h2>March 8th, 2015, by Hayden Wagner</h2>

                <span>School of Media Sciences – MS Print Media</span>

                <p>The School of Media Sciences is a world authority in the management, production and distribution of
                    content through platforms including print, web, mobile and social media. Our programs focus on
                    leadership and project management.</p>

                <p>Boasting one of the highest placement rates in the field, the School of Media Sciences places
                    graduates in graphic communications and related industries. School of Media Sciences graduates are
                    prepared as future industry leaders through their experiences in the management of communication
                    processes, business operations, and product development.</p>

                <span>Curriculum</span>
                <p>The program requires 36 semester credit hours of study and includes six core courses, four electives,
                    and a thesis. The curriculum exposes students to the foundations of the industry with a research
                    focus. The program takes full advantage of RIT’s innovative and cutting-edge resources by placing
                    students in an integrated environment containing the latest equipment and software used throughout
                    the industry. You will find the course offerings and faculty expertise in our program are quite
                    diverse.</p>

                <span>Electives</span>
                <p>Electives are comprised of selected courses offered by the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences or
                    other RIT colleges. In addition to Print Media electives, students can take graduate elective
                    courses from a variety of disciplines at RIT such as business, packaging, imaging science and
                    communication.</p>

                <span>Thesis</span>
                <p>Print Media graduate students work with expert faculty and focus on a particular area of thesis
                    research in areas including content management, publishing workflows, typography and layout,
                    business trends, color management, and applications of printing. Faculty work with the graduate
                    students to customize their electives in a way that will lead them into thesis research that will
                    help them in their prospective career path.</p>

                <p>Along with three semesters of course work, each student completes research and a written thesis.
                    Courses in the graduate program combine theory and application, providing graduate students with
                    information about current industry trends, problem solving and research skills.</p>

                    learn the basic theory of image reproduction embodied in the available analog and digital printing
                    processes, and learn to identify the process origins of print samples. Additionally, students will
                    learn the chemical and physical properties associated with consumables in order to obtain an
                    understanding necessary to make informed decisions about use and application.</p>

                <span>Tone and Color Analysis</span>
                <p>This course covers fundamentals of color measurement, color management system, and color reproduction
                    technology for color matching and color image reproduction. Emphases are placed on CIE colorimetry,
                    device calibration and characterization, and color management systems.</p>

                <span>Operations Management in the Graphic Arts</span>
                <p>An in-depth study of the factors affecting the efficiencies and effectiveness of print media
                    organizations and ultimately their profitability. Includes consideration of both internal factors,
                    such as quality level goals, training, scheduling, plant layout, and financial management, and
                    external factors, such as environmental and legal issues and safety enforcement.</p>

                <span>Cross Media Workflow</span>
                <p>This course is designed to expose students to all the elements needed to master a cross media
                    publishing project. Students will learn concepts and laws around copyright as it applies to cross
                    media publishing. Concepts and tools necessary for the implementation of a cross media workflow will
                    be discussed and reinforced with hands-on exercises. Additionally, ways companies create and utilize
                    cross media workflows will be studied. Emerging industry and ISO standards as well as best practices
                    for each of the fields discussed in the course will be presented.</p>

                <span>Research Methods and Trends in Graphic Media</span>
                <p>The course provides a foundation for conducting scientific research in the graphic communications

                    question, conduct secondary research, select the best research design to answer the research
                    questions, and how to analyze basic survey data. The course will also introduce students to the
                    current issues in the industry in preparation for them to identify a thesis or capstone project
                    problem.</p>

                <span>Statistical Analysis and Decision Making</span>
                <p>This is a course in applied statistics emphasizing an understanding of variation and inference

                    communication industry. It provides an in-depth analysis of key technologies as well as business,
                    environmental and regulatory issues. This course provides a capstone experience that contributes to
                    the student’s fuller understanding of changes in graphic communication constituencies and their role
                    within the industry. By tracing historical roots, analyzing present issues and detailing future
                    trends, students are prepared develop insights into the nature and scope of the major challenges

                <span>Transmedia Publishing</span>
                <p>Transmedia Publishing is a form of multimedia communications that tells stories from a database of
                    media assets. It differs from conventional publishing in that the reader dynamically participates in
                    shaping the story and the story is adapted to the channel used to distribute it. Students create
                    stories through the application of the theoretical principles, methods and tools employed in
                    transmedia publishing and storytelling.</p>

                <span>Typography Research</span>
                <p>The course builds on fundamentals and skills taught in introductory and advanced typography courses
                    by developing methods of investigation, research, and analysis, with the goal of enabling students
                    to conduct independent research. Students will choose individual typographic topics to research
                    (e.g. technology, psychology, history, aesthetics, imaging, writing systems, culture, and society).
                    Course lectures survey these topics. Students each give presentations on their topics and prepare a
                    written a report. The course emphasizes individual initiative and seminar participation.</p>
