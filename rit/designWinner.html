                <h2>April 22nd, 2015, by Shantinique Cowans
                </h2>
                <p>Everyone looks forward to the amazing, innovative spectacle that is Imagine RIT. Everyone sees the
                    poster that is designed each year to hand out to the public and be displayed all over campus for
                    this huge event. Well, the School of Media Science’s very own Meagan Daymont took over the
                    competition when it came to designing this year’s Imagine RIT poster.</p>

                <p>Meagan was very excited to have achieved this great honor. I was just as excited to sit down with her
                    and ask her some questions regarding her workflow, role here as an SMS student, and plans for life
                    after graduation. She was eager to talk with me and even had some advice to offer students who are
                    anticipating graduation.</p>

                <p>Meagan is a fourth year student from Lowville, NY who came in as a transfer student three years ago
                    from Mohawk Valley Community College. While at MVCC, she earned an Associate in Applied Science
                    (AAS) in Graphic Design as well as an AAS in Arts Technology. Here at RIT she is a Media Arts and
                    Technology major with a concentration in Communication.</p>

                <p>
                    <p>While here at RIT, she is currently doing a co-op in the SMS office Whatever they need in the
                        office, she’s their girl! Whether they need posters printed, websites updated or just some
                        errands to be taken care of, she gets it done. She also did a co-op with Cunard Cruise Line,
                        aboard the Queen Mary II ship. She was able to see a lot of the world in her 6 months at sea
                        from December to June. “I think everyone should try that. It’s a good experience and you get to
                        see the world,” she told me. She worked as the printer’s assistant and helped co-manage the
                        print shop. Her duties included preparing menus, newspapers, brochures, daily programs,
                        invitations, etc.</p>

                    <p>She went into some detail with me on her workflow for creating the design for the Imagine poster
                        everyone loves so much. She started working on the design back in August of 2014. She started by
                        looking through Pinterest at some Disney poster designs that were displayed on the site. She
                        then began looking through Illustrator tutorials to help guide in making her vision a reality.
                        Once she started searching for ideas and developing an overall plan, everything just fell
                        together. “The background was the most difficult. Originally, the background was going to be
                        orange and blue,” she told me. She decided to instead go with more neutral tones. And as you all
                        can see, it came out great!</p>

                    <p>Meagan was very humble about this great achievement. When asked if she had a great chance at
                        winning she told me, “When it was uploaded and it was shown what everyone had done, I thought,
                        ‘Aww man! I have an awesome chance! There was a lot of stiff competition.’ There were some
                        things where I was like these are amazing, they should definitely win!” Her hard work and
                        dedication she put into her design was definitely well deserved and has paid off. She is going
                        to use the prize money she won to go to Disney World with her mom.</p>

                    <p>After graduation, Meagan told me she is hoping to “look for a full-time job. I am looking both
                        locally, here…and all over the map. I don’t exactly know where I want to go, but I do know I am
                        more printer than I am multimedia.” She’s considering going into the workforce for a few years,
                        then applying for grad school to continue her education and her professional growth. Meagan’s
                        advice is, “you have to find something you love.” Meagan sure has an awesome future ahead of her
                        and we wish her all the best!</p>
