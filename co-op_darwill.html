            <h2>October 5th, 2015, by Megan Cooper
</h2>
            <p>Over the summer Brianna Juda and Megan Cooper had the opportunity to co-op at Darwill Inc. Darwill is a direct mail and marketing company located outside of Chicago, Illinois. During their three-month co-op Brianna worked with the Creative team and Megan worked with the Account Management team. Both positions gave them the opportunity to be fully immersed in the print production business.</p>

            <p>Darwill participated in the Spring 2015 Career Fair at RIT where they met students in the Media Arts and Technology major and found Brianna and Megan. Both were thrilled to spend their summer in Chicago and eager to learn how they would apply the skills they learned in school to the company.</p>

            <p>In Brianna’s department,her daily routine consisted of creating and manipulating layout designs, and scheduling and managing social media and blogs. “It was amazing to see how the skills I had learned in just 2 years had already prepared me for a full time job in the field. My bosses were impressed with how much I knew already, and it allowed me to gain trust quickly to work on large and exciting projects.”</p>

            <p>Megan’s role in the account management team was to take the work provided by the Creative team, or a client, and manage the project through production. She worked directly with the client and production team to make sure the clients’ goals for the project was met while making sure production had time to complete it on the due date. “I loved being a part of this team at Darwill because there was always something different to do every day. Each project I was given came with something new to learn about the print production process while applying what I already knew about print from RIT.”</p>

            <p>Overall, being a part of Darwill for the summer was a great experience. Both learned a lot from our co-workers and got to explore a new city for the summer. Make sure to keep an eye out for Darwill at the next Career Fair; they are a company you don’t want to miss!</p>
