                <h2>December 23rd, 2014, by Brianna Juda
                </h2>
                <p>Webpage Production I is a 2nd year course offered in the fall semester. Prior to this year, the
                    course was only available for SMS students in the Golisano building; however, many students felt as
                    if the course did not go deep enough into the basics. For this reason, this semester Webpage was
                    brought into the SMS building and is currently taught by Professor Graham Anthony.</p>

                <p>In this course, students learn how to identify content as well as separate format from content.
                    Students get an in-depth learning of the building blocks of HTML, CSS, and SASS in this course, and
                    how to use these building blocks to solve problems. This course causes students to shift their
                    mindset from programs such as InDesign, and focus on using abstract materials as a foundation to
                    create their own brand of creativity. The skills learned in this course are another tool for the
                    Media Architect to have under their belt for the work force.</p>

                <p>Webpage Production I only covers the basics, but equips students with the ability to ask the right
                    questions when it comes to tackling new problems. Professor Anthony admits that the class moves
                    fast; however, each tool builds upon its predecessor making the flow of the class easy to follow.
                    The programs used for this class were hand picked by Professor Anthony for their market share and
                    accessibility, meaning almost all of the programs used are open source and easy for students to get
                    their hands on and work outside of the labs.</p>

                <p>One of the reasons this course is vital to the MAAT program is because as Media Architects we work as
                    “the bridge”. This means we have to understand all parts of the workflow, including the coding
                    aspect. In the past, students have felt held back because of a weakened skill set in this area, but
                    to be a jack-of-all-trades, the fundamental understanding of webpage production is necessary. This
                    rigorous course is a gateway to coding and Webpage design, which will push students to new levels of
                    creativity.</p>

                <p>Webpage Production II is the second installment of this course and is offered in the spring. Current
                    Webpage Production I students can look forward to learning about Javascript, the fundamentals of
                    programming. Any students that are interested in the next step after Webpage I and II should look
                    into courses in Golisano to learn about production from the server side, known as PHP.</p>
