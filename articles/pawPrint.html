                <h2>November 3rd, 2013, by Allison Rose Ritter</h2>

                <p>The Connect members of the School of Media Sciences envisioned an interactive activity that would
                    engage users and give them license to use their own imagination. This idea eventually developed into
                    project PawPrint; a project that allows users to personalize stories through dynamic input in a
                    web-based interface. The user can customize different aspects of the storybook such as character
                    appearance, story setting, favorite color, and many other options. There are thousands of possible
                    combinations to create ones own adventure. These selections are reflected in the story and provide
                    the user with visual feedback in regard to their modifications; giving the user a sense of personal
                    style and accomplishment at the completion of their tale.</p>
                <p>To execute this project the team made the input form web-based and connected it to a database server
                    that retained the information. When a user entered information, the options chosen would
                    automatically be entered into a server and ExtendScript would create a custom InDesign file with the
                    variables the user had selected. This unique file would then be processed into the userâ€™s
                    personalized storybook and converted into a PDF that was then emailed to the participant. The book
                    can then be printed or viewed on a computer or tablet.</p>
                <p>PawPrint was launched at the 2013 Imagine RIT Innovation and Creativity Festival and it was also
                    exhibited this summer at the Wegmans LPGA. On October 10, 2013 PawPrint was presented at the annual
                    Cross-Media Innovation Center (CMIC) Summit. The CMIC at RIT is focused on addressing the
                    significant economic, technological, and cultural changes that impact the graphic communications
                    industry. CMIC understands that the changes in our industry require future graphic communications
                    professionals to know how to integrate with all types of media. Through the collaborative efforts
                    the Graphic Communications Industry, students, and educators, the CMIC provides a platform to
                    address the issues and opportunities that are a part of the cross-media communications field.</p>
                <p>Alumna Katie Cooper and senior Gabrielle Barandiaran of the School of Media Sciences presented
                    PawPrint at the CMIC Summit this year. They demonstrated the product itself and the process the
                    students used to develop PawPrint. The students had a great time developing this project and were
                    excited to present their creation at the CMIC Summit 2013.</p>
