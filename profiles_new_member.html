                <h2>February 16th, 2014, by Kathryn Cooper</h2>
            
                <p>For our first issue after the winter holiday break we would like to introduce the newest addition to our Connect group, Zach Sterling!  Zach is a student in the School of Media Sciences with a minor in Advertising and Public Relations. Walworth, New York just a half hour from Rochester is where Zach calls home and for the 6 months Zach has been commuting here to RIT. He came to RIT from Finger Lakes Community College where he studied graphic design, however, Zach soon realized that graphic design wasn’t for him.  If it weren’t for the Media Arts and Technology (MAAT) program Zach wouldn’t even be here, he read about our major after transferring to RIT and decided to switch into the MAAT program.</p>

<p>Through this interview I learned that Zach loves rock music of all kinds and he plays the drums. I asked him what his favorite band was and like any real music lover he struggled to choose, though he settled with saying that his current favorite band is AFI. Much like his fellow RIT students Zach spends a lot of time doing homework and his aspirations after graduation include, not so surprisingly, getting a job. If you see Zach around ask him about Olympic hockey! He’s not much of a sports guy, but with the Sochi Olympics on TV, Zach has decided that hockey may not be all that bad (RIT is glad to be converting him!).</p>
<p>When talking to Zach, I asked him how he became aware of Connect and he explained that he was in Professor Heusner’s Advanced Retouching class when she told him, “I need to talk to you after class.”  He admitted that he thought Professor Heusner was going to inform him that he was failing the class! He was pleasantly surprised when he was invited to join our team.  And we certainly are happy to have him.</p>
